# A simple integration with Metamask
* A very simple integration with Metamask using only HTML/JS.
* I hope this will help anyone who struggling in finding a starting point to integrate with Metamask.

### SETUP
* I have also added a `docker-compose.yml`, so you can run this project without requiring to setup a web server.
* After the docker container is up, you can access to demo pages.

`docker-compose up -d`

### 1. Send ethereum transaction
